// memory allocated during compile time is called static memory.
// the memory allocated is fixed and connot be increased or decreased during run time.

// problems in static allocation is if you are allocating for an array compile time then you have to fix the size
// at the time of declaration. size is fixed and user cannot increase or decrease the size of the memory at run time.

// if the values stored by the user in the array at run time is less than the size specified then there will be 
// wastage of memory.
